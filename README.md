# Spawners #
This MOD for Minetest let the player craft mob Spawner blocks. Mobs are spawning randomly in a short intervals.

Easy to implement new mob mods just look in to config.lua.

Currently it works with [Pyramids Mummy](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?id=7063), [Mobs Redo](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=9917) and [Creatures](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=8638).

### 0.2 ###
* support pyramids mod - mummy
* support creatures mod
* shorten the code - more effecient

### 0.1 ###
* Initial Release
* detects only 6 nodes for 'air' around the spawner [top, bottom, left, right, front, back] afterwards it will check the node above and below the found 'air' node - so there is enough space to spawn someone
* always picks random side from where the mob will spawn
* detects for light and time of day - spawn mobs only at night if 'only_night' set to true
* status 'waiting' - blue sparkles, for not enough light (day spawners) or too much light for night spawners
* status 'default/inactive' i.e. if the spawner is closed from each side or there is no space to spawn mob
* status 'active' when spawner is active and is spawning mobs
* status 'overheat' when there is too much 'max_objects_per_block' (prevents from server errors), max value is taken from minetest.conf
* easy to configure, add and remove MODs for mobs
* only [Mobs Redo](https://github.com/tenplus1/mobs) from tenplus1 is added for now
* added recipes for all spawners, it's expensive so it will not get overcrowded on the server only with spawners 
* almost everything is done dynamically
* spawners emit small amount of light
* active and overheated spawner can cause fire to flammable nodes around it
* spawners are active only if player is in radius (21)
* spawners are diggable only with steel pickaxe and above, so no noob griefers can raid your base too easy
* mobs play sound when spawned
* animated textures
